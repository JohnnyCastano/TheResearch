            <li class="mile1"><div><i>Motorola's DynaTAC 8000X</i></div>, the name of the first ever mobile cellphone, one of the greatest milestones in the history of technology. This technological masterpiece was created by a Motorola engineer named Martin Cooper. The first ever mobile telephone was, as some say, "the brick", and they were not wrong. The telephone weighed about two pounds and was not very practical, although this changed the world. The telephone was almost three times the size of the first ever iPhone. The telephone was rectangular shaped, it had and antenna at the top, it then had a speaker at the top of the telephone case. At the bottom of it there was a microphone. In between the speaker and the microphone was buttons with number and buttons that said end, lock, etc... below the numbers.
            Inside of the telephone was a <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z_R8hb6BGC8/XZ4F8e8bSBI/AAAAAAAAJhE/kMimaWGJupspLLpVi3UyY_Vq88nAUvAUQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/FirstVersions_Motorola-DynaTAC-ad-Jun1973.png">synthesizer</a>(it generated 380 channels electronically), a battery (the battery delivers 14-volts of power for 36 minutes of transmission), a reciever, a supervisory unit (it is the brain, it recieves and sends digital signals to central computers), a triselector (a series of transmission lines), and a transmitter. The circuits are separated with soldered sheet metal.
            The phones battery took ten hours to charge, that only lasted about 30 minutes, and could only save a total of 30 phone numbers. When it officially was released to the public, the price of the telephone was $3,995 dollars. Today the DynaTac 8000x, or "the brick" goes for around $10,000, and is a milestone in technology that will never be forgotten.

                <div><i>Texting</i></div>Texting is somethings that happens millions and millions of times every single day, it has changed the  way we communicate just like phone calls have. The concept of texting was first thought of by the Franco-German GSM cooperation in 1984 by Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert. It wasn't until many years later that the first ever text message was actually sent. 
                The first message was sent on December 3rd, 1992 by Neil Papworth (former developer at Sema Group Telecoms), Neil at that time 
                sent the message on a pc since telephones did not have keyboards at that time, the message was sent to Richard Jarvis at Vodafane, the message said "Merry Christmas", it was successfully sent. Texting did not work with telephones until the Nokia 9000i came out in 1997 (with a full keyboard) which supported the use of SMS text messages. Although it was not much of use at the beginning since it could not send messsages to different people over long distances. It wasn't until several years later, in the year 
                2000 when texting could be done over different networks, which increased its usefulness. Now (in that time) the average American sent around 35 texts a month. Now texting can be done in multiple different ways, through multiple different platforms like messenger, snapchat, instagram and more all over the world. Texting has revolutionized the way human beings communicate. Texting can now be done in milliseconds from anywhere in the world. Its one of the greates milestones in technology.

                <div><i>Applications</i></div>Apps are probably one of the most important features that was first revealed with the Nokia 6110 (built-in version of the arcade name snake), and later with the smart phone. In the year 1983, the young Steve Jobs thought of the app tore, a very basic version of it. Then apple's iPod lauched, shortly after the iTunes store was launched, leaving the building-blocks for the Apple App Store. In June 2007 the first iPhone was launched. I was a huge success. It was not until a year later that the app store was launched with several native apps, such as angry birds. After that more and more apps were being released, each being very different. There was social media, which is now one of the most used things in the world, it allows you to see what other people are doing, and where they are, even yourself. Even more things started to come out, entertainment apps, such as youtube and netflix where you could watch content anywhere. Many other games came out as well. Apps that help you, such as the calculator,and the religious text for some people. Today, apps are one of the most used and useful things that we every single day, wether it be to entertain ourselves or te get help, apps are always there. That is all thinks to the genius of Steve Jobs and his co-workers. It has revolutionized the way we live life on a daily basis. One of the greatest milestones in technology to this day.

                <div><i>The Internet</i></div>The internet, some say it is the most important invention in the 21st century, and the most important in technological advancements. The idea of the internet was brought by one of the greatest inventors of his time, Nikola Tesla. Tesla thought of the idea of a "world wireless system". It was not until several years later that the internet was created. In the early 1960's, MIT J.C.R. Licklider introduced the idea of an "Intergalactic Network" of computers. Not long after several computer scientists developed the concept of "packet switching", a method that allowed for transmitting electronic data, this was a building block for the internet. The first workable prototype of the internet cam in the late 1960's, with the creation of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). It used packet switching to allow several computers to work on a singular network. On October 29, 1969, the ARPAnet delivered its first message, it was a "node-to-node" communication from one computer to another. One computer was in UCLA, while the other in Stanford. The message said "LOGIN", but it immediately crashed the ARPA network. The Stanford computer only recieved the messages first two letters. Technology only continued to grow from there. On January 1, 1983, ARPANET adopted TCP/IP, researchers began to assemble the "network of networks", this became the moder internet. This is as well one of technologies greatest milestones that changed our lives forever, all the information in the world in our hands.

                <div><i>The iPhone</i></div>The iPhone, it is the most famous telephone company in the entire world, it is a billion dollar company, and has the most selling tech gadget in the world, as well as the most influential. Steve Jobs anounced the iPhone on January 9, 2007, on stage at the Macworld conference. Jobs spent an hour explaining the device to the people. In the presentation, Jobs made a phone call to a real Starbucks and real person and and ordered the biggest Starbucks order ever. The smartphone came out six months from the original reveal. The product was mass-produced, people lined-up outside the stores just to get one. Apple sold 270,000 iPhones the first weekend it was available, it hit 1 million by Labor Day, it instantly became the peoples favorite. The next iphone 1 year later cam out, it included support for 3g networks, it gave much faster koading times in emails , and websites. This is the phone that added the App Store. Some say the App Store is Apples greatest contribution to the tech industry and society. Many different apps came in like the ones said before. Apple kept evolving and every year Apple made the phone bigger, better, and faster, it also just kept getting more popular and popular. The iPhone 4 included one of the best cameras in phones at that time. Now in the newest iPhone, The iPhone 12, there are many new features that people could not even imagine. Now there is face id that makes it only you be able to open you phone id you would like, and many more. The iPhone is one of the greatest technological advancements in the 21st century.
